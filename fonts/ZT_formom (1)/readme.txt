This font is designed full of emotion, this font is a masterpiece for my mother who just left this world. so I made it free for you to use, hope it's useful for your design.

To my mom, I love you even if you feel it or not. You should know how to love yourself, I know you are tormented for the sake of other people being happy and even though you are suffering, you don't want to change your way of life. There is still a lot that I haven't had the chance to tell you. There is still a lot that I haven't had the chance to tell you.

Irreplaceable Even though we don't say hello anymore

Thanks My Hero.
